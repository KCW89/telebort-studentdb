## Teacher Feedback
> "The student has demonstrated exceptional dedication throughout his learning journey, maintaining an outstanding 94% attendance rate across both programs. His progression has been particularly noteworthy, showing significant improvement during the later stages of the JavaScript curriculum and carrying that momentum into Svelte learning. The student's graduation from the JavaScript program and his strong performance in Quiz 2 reflect his growing mastery of programming concepts. While he is currently adapting to Svelte's more advanced features like data binding (reflected in recent ★★★☆☆ ratings), his consistent attendance and commitment to completing all projects position him well for continued growth. The improvement in his ratings from the early JavaScript sessions to his current work demonstrates a positive learning trajectory that bodes well for his future development." — Yasmin

- **Gain**: +827 sessions  
- **New Coverage**: 36.8%
- **Techniques**:
  - Normalized teacher names in attendance ‚Üí "Attended"
  - Sequential lesson progression for attended sessions
  - Pattern extraction from lesson formats (L1, S1 L1, etc.)

### Stage 4: Maximum Coverage Algorithm

- **Gain**: +859 sessions
- **New Coverage**: 55.8%
- **Techniques**:
  - Session number mapping

### Stage 5: Predictive Modeling
- **Method**: Machine learning and pattern recognition
- **Gain**: +297 sessions
- **Final Coverage**: **62.3%**
- **Techniques Applied**:
  - Cohort-based prediction (117 sessions)
  - Cross-student patterns (179 sessions)
  - Temporal interpolation (1 session)

## üî¨ Predictive Model Details

### 1. Cohort-Based Prediction
- **Principle**: Students in same program on same date learn same topics
- **Success Rate**: 114/683 patterns applied
- **Confidence**: 0.7-0.9 (high)
- **Example**: If 5 students have Session 10 on 2024-10-20, and 3 have "HTML Basics", predict this for the other 2

### 2. Cross-Student Pattern Recognition
- **Principle**: Students in same program follow similar curriculum paths
- **Success Rate**: 177 predictions made
- **Confidence**: 0.6-0.7 (medium-high)
- **Example**: All Web-3 students do "Bootstrap" in Session 5

### 3. Temporal Interpolation
- **Principle**: Fill gaps between known lessons
- **Success Rate**: 1 prediction (limited applicability)
- **Confidence**: 0.5-0.6 (medium)
- **Example**: If L3 on Day 1 and L5 on Day 14, then L4 likely on Day 7

## Teacher Feedback:

The student is a consistent attendee who is actively participating in the UI/UX design program. They are engaging with the various modules and attempting the exercises. While they have shown progress, some of their exit ticket scores suggest that they may benefit from spending more time reviewing the concepts and practicing the skills learned in class. We encourage them to focus on improving their understanding in these areas.

## Suggestions for Parents:

* Encourage the student to review the concepts and exercises, particularly focusing on areas where exit ticket scores were lower.
* Discuss the importance of practice and application in mastering new design skills.
* Support them in allocating dedicated time for studying and working on projects.

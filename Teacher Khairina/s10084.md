## Teacher Feedback:

The student is an engaged learner who actively participates in the UI/UX design program. They are making consistent progress through the modules, completing exercises and showing an understanding of the core concepts. Their work on the Mini Project 1 and the Brand Guideline indicates a good grasp of practical application. Encouragement to review areas with slightly lower exit ticket scores will further enhance their learning.

## Suggestions for Parents:

* Encourage the student to continue exploring UI/UX design principles through online resources and design inspiration websites.
* Discuss the importance of user-centered design and the concepts learned in class.
* Support them in practicing wireframing and prototyping using Figma or other tools.

## Next Steps / Parent Actions:

* [ ] Review the student's progress in the Learning Progress Table, paying attention to the exit ticket scores.
* [ ] Discuss their understanding of user flow and wireframe development.
* [ ] Encourage them to explore the concepts of Material Design further.
* [ ] Feel free to reach out to the instructor with any questions or observations.

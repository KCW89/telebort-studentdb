## Teacher Feedback:

The student is a dedicated and consistent learner in the AI and Machine Learning program. They have a strong attendance record and actively participate in the lessons. They have shown good progress in various modules, including completing projects and exercises. We encourage them to review the concepts where their exit ticket scores were slightly lower to further enhance their understanding. They are currently working on their final project proposal.

## Suggestions for Parents:

* Continue to support the student's interest in AI and Machine Learning.
* Encourage them to review the topics where they might need further clarification.
* Discuss their final project proposal and offer any support needed.

## Next Steps / Parent Actions:

* [ ] Review the student's progress in the Learning Progress Table, noting the exit ticket scores.
* [ ] Discuss their understanding of Deep Learning and Object Detection.
* [ ] Encourage them to continue their hard work and seek clarification on any challenging topics.
* [ ] Feel free to reach out to the instructor with any questions or suggestions.

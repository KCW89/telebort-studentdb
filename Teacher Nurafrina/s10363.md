## Skill Growth & Behavior

### Technical Skills
- Good understanding of Python fundamentals (variables, lists, conditions, loops)
- Growing proficiency with more advanced data structures (dictionaries)
- Developing skills in data analysis with NumPy and descriptive statistics
- Experience with practical applications through the Covid-19 Cases Prediction project

### Soft Skills
- Shows determination to complete projects despite occasional challenges
- Demonstrates improvement in complex topics (dictionaries, functions)
- Ability to work with multiple instructors throughout the program
- Shows interest in data analysis applications

### Challenges
- Irregular attendance pattern (71%) with occasional absences
- Some inconsistency in progress ratings (ranging from ★★☆☆☆ to ★★★★☆)
- Several late arrivals noted in the attendance records
- Sometimes needs more time with complex project implementations

## Teacher Feedback
> "The student has demonstrated good progress throughout Program F, particularly in recent modules covering Functions, Packages, and Dictionary applications where they achieved ★★★★☆ ratings. Their work on the Covid-19 Cases Prediction project shows developing analytical skills, and they are now building a foundation in NumPy and descriptive statistics. While the student's attendance has been somewhat irregular (71%), they generally maintain continuity in their learning. I've observed that when the student attends consistently, their performance improves noticeably, as evidenced by their stronger ratings in February. Their recent work with statistical concepts shows growing maturity in approaching programming challenges, though there is room for more consistent engagement to maximize learning outcomes." — Nurafrina

## Suggestions for Parents

### Support Continued Learning
- Encourage regular attendance to maintain learning continuity
- Review Python concepts between classes, particularly data analysis topics
- Practice NumPy operations and statistical concepts with simple datasets
- Ensure completion of any missed work due to absences

### Engagement Opportunities
- Explore simple data analysis projects that apply learned Python concepts
- Consider working with online resources like Kaggle for additional practice
- Discuss real-world applications of data analysis to maintain interest
- Set up a regular practice schedule to reinforce programming concepts

### Project Extensions
- Enhance the Covid-19 Cases Prediction project with additional analysis
- Practice creating visualizations of statistical data
- Experiment with different NumPy functions on various datasets
- Apply dictionary and function concepts to create more complex programs

## Next Steps / Parent Actions
- [ ] Discuss attendance patterns and develop a plan for more consistent participation
- [ ] Review recent work with NumPy and statistics to reinforce understanding
- [ ] Establish a regular schedule for Python practice between classes
- [ ] Consider additional resources to support learning of data analysis concepts
- [ ] Communicate with instructor about specific areas needing additional support

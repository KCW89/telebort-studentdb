## Teacher Feedback

"The student shows good potential and has demonstrated a solid understanding of programming concepts when present. Their Quiz 1 score of 80/100 indicates a good grasp of the foundational materials covered. However, their inconsistent attendance has been hindering their ability to fully benefit from the program and build upon concepts in a sequential manner." - Rahmat

## Suggestions for Parents

* Encourage regular attendance to ensure continuous learning and better progress
* Consider setting aside dedicated time for practice with EdublockS at home, especially after missed sessions
* Review the Block-based Python concepts covered in class together to reinforce learning
* Reach out to instructors for materials from missed sessions to help catch up

## Next Steps / Parent Actions

* [ ] Review this report with the student
* [ ] Create a schedule to ensure consistent attendance for future sessions
* [ ] Follow up with Rahmat regarding materials from missed sessions
* [ ] Help establish a regular practice routine at home to reinforce concepts

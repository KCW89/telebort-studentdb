# Data Quality Analysis Report - Student Reports

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 101 student reports reveals significant data quality issues stemming from the Google Sheets data entry process. While all students have reports, **70% contain data inconsistencies** that impact report accuracy and usefulness.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Teacher Names in Attendance Field (71% of reports affected)**

**Problem**: The Google Sheets instructions say "write your name if student attended", causing teacher names to appear instead of "Attended"

**Impact**: 
- 656 instances across 71 reports
- Cannot accurately calculate attendance rates
- Breaks data validation rules
- Requires complex cleaning logic

**Root Cause**: Sheet header instruction: *"write your name if student attended, or use 'Absent', 'In Break', 'No Class'"*

**Examples Found**:
```
| 19/07/2025 | 1 | L1 Introduction to AI | Soumiya | Completed |  ← Wrong
| 19/07/2025 | 1 | L1 Introduction to AI | Attended | Completed | ← Correct
```

### 2. **Missing Session Data (100% of reports affected)**

**Problem**: Every report has at least one session with all dashes "- | - | -"

**Impact**:
- Latest sessions often completely empty
- Historical data gaps
- Cannot track current progress

**Pattern**: Usually the most recent week (e.g., 02/08/2025 or 09/08/2025)

### 3. **Missing Schedule Information (20% of reports affected)**

**Problem**: Schedule field shows just "-" instead of day/time

**Affected Reports**: s10213, s10710, s10779, s10100, s10084, s10723, s10726, s10808, s10360, s10767, s10708, s10510, s10809, s10707, s10609, s10608, s10569, s10805, s10802, s10801

**Impact**:
- Cannot determine class timing
- Difficult to group students by class
- Missing context for attendance patterns

### 4. **Inconsistent Progress Values**

**Problem**: Mix of formats for progress tracking

**Variations Found**:
- "Completed" vs "COMPLETED"
- "In Progress" vs "IN PROGRESS" 
- "-" vs empty vs "Not Started"
- Multiple statuses in one field: "COMPLETED (for final presentation not yet)"

### 5. **Mixed Content in Lesson Fields**

**Problem**: Lesson fields contain multiple types of data mixed together

**Examples**:
```
"L2: Supervised & Unsupervised Learning https://www.telebort.com/demo/ai1/lesson/12 https://forms.gle/EzCaq ET: 5/5"
```

**Issues**:
- URLs mixed with lesson titles
- Multiple lessons in one field with \n separators
- Exit ticket scores appended
- Form links included
- Inconsistent formatting

### 6. **Session Number Inconsistencies**

**Problem**: Session numbers don't follow logical progression

**Patterns**:
- Session 0 used for breaks/holidays
- Sessions restart when switching programs (26 → 1)
- Missing session numbers in sequence
- Same session number repeated multiple times

## Data Completeness Statistics

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total Reports | 101 | 100% |
| Reports with teacher names in attendance | 71 | 70.3% |
| Reports with missing schedule | 20 | 19.8% |
| Reports with empty latest session | 101 | 100% |
| Reports with mixed lesson formats | ~85 | ~84% |
| Reports with inconsistent progress | ~60 | ~59% |

## Root Causes in Google Sheets

### 1. **Poor Data Entry Instructions**
- Sheet says "write your name if student attended" 
- Should say "Enter 'Attended' if student present"

### 2. **No Data Validation**
- Attendance field accepts any text
- Progress field has no dropdown
- No format enforcement

### 3. **Horizontal Structure Issues**
- Teachers scroll to column DZ+ to find current week
- Easy to enter data in wrong columns
- No visual guidance for current week

### 4. **Mixed Purpose Fields**
- Lesson field used for titles, URLs, scores, and notes
- No separate fields for different data types

## Recommendations for Immediate Improvement

### Priority 1: Fix Attendance Field Instructions

**Current**: "write your name if student attended"

**Change to**: "Select from: Attended, Absent, No Class, Public Holiday"

**Implementation**:
1. Update header text in row 2
2. Add data validation dropdown
3. Train teachers on correct values

### Priority 2: Add Data Validation

Create dropdowns for:
- **Attendance**: [Attended, Absent, No Class, Public Holiday]
- **Progress**: [Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Graduated]

### Priority 3: Separate URL Fields

Split lesson field into:
- Lesson_Title
- Lesson_URL
- Activity_URL  
- Exit_Ticket_Score
- Notes

### Priority 4: Fix Missing Latest Sessions

Add script to:
1. Auto-populate current week's date
2. Pre-fill with previous week's lesson (marked "Continuing")
3. Alert if no update after class time

### Priority 5: Standardize Progress Values

Map all variations to standard values:
- "COMPLETED", "Completed", "completed" → "Completed"
- "IN PROGRESS", "In Progress" → "In Progress"
- "-", "", null → "Not Started"

## Data Cleaning Required

### Immediate Fixes in Processing Scripts

```python
# Fix teacher names in attendance
TEACHER_NAMES = ['Soumiya', 'Han Yang', 'Khairina', 'Arrvinna', 
                 'Syahin', 'Hafiz', 'Yasmin', 'Nurafrina']

if attendance in TEACHER_NAMES:
    attendance = 'Attended'
    actual_teacher = attendance  # Preserve teacher info

# Standardize progress
progress_map = {
    'COMPLETED': 'Completed',
    'IN PROGRESS': 'In Progress',
    'completed': 'Completed',
    'in progress': 'In Progress',
    '-': 'Not Started',
    '': 'Not Started'
}
progress = progress_map.get(progress, progress)

# Extract lesson components
import re
lesson_parts = re.match(r'^(L\d+[^:]*:?\s*[^h\n]+)(?:\s+(https?://\S+))?', lesson)
if lesson_parts:
    lesson_title = lesson_parts.group(1).strip()
    lesson_url = lesson_parts.group(2) if lesson_parts.group(2) else ''
```

## Long-term Solution: Vertical Data Structure

As documented in our previous analysis, moving to a vertical structure would solve most issues:

**Benefits**:
- One row per student per week
- No horizontal scrolling
- Easy data validation
- Better mobile support
- Reduced errors by 95%

## Impact on Report Quality

### Current State
- Reports are generated but with inconsistent data
- Attendance rates may be incorrect
- Progress tracking unreliable
- Missing current status for many students

### After Improvements
- Accurate attendance tracking
- Clear progress indicators
- Complete lesson history
- Reliable metrics for analysis

## Action Plan

## Conclusion

The student report system successfully generates reports for all 101 students, but data quality issues significantly impact their usefulness. The root cause is poor data entry design in Google Sheets, particularly the instruction for teachers to write their names instead of "Attended".

**Immediate actions** (data cleaning in scripts) can improve report quality by 40-50%. **Medium-term changes** (Google Sheets validation) can improve quality by 70-80%. **Long-term structural changes** (vertical format) would achieve 95%+ data quality.

The system is functional but requires these improvements to become truly reliable for tracking student progress and generating actionable insights.

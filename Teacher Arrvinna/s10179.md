## Skill Growth & Behavior

### Technical Skills
- Strong understanding of object detection techniques (YOLOv8, Haar Cascades)
- Good foundation in machine learning fundamentals (supervised/unsupervised learning)
- Successfully completed a final project and presentation
- Proficient in working with computer vision libraries (OpenCV)

### Soft Skills
- Consistent effort in completing assignments even when concepts are challenging
- Persistence in developing presentation slides over multiple sessions
- Able to work independently on projects
- Demonstrated improvement in presenting technical concepts

### Challenges
- Room for improvement in quiz performance (44/100 on Quiz 2)
- Inconsistent attendance pattern (7 absences throughout the program)
- Variable understanding of deep learning concepts (scoring 1/3 on deep learning exit ticket)
- Occasional difficulty with project application (e.g., 0/5 on Mall Customer Segmentation exit ticket)

## Teacher Feedback
> "The student has shown dedication to mastering computer vision techniques throughout the AI-2 program. Their strengths lie in practical implementation, particularly with object detection using YOLOv8, where they consistently achieved good results. While their theoretical knowledge still has room for growth as evidenced by quiz scores, their persistence in developing and completing the final project demonstrates commendable determination. With more consistent attendance and focus on bridging theoretical concepts with practical applications, the student has excellent potential for further growth in AI development." — Arrvinna

## Suggestions for Parents

### Support Continued Learning
- Encourage review of theoretical AI concepts to strengthen quiz performance
- Explore additional computer vision projects to build on existing strengths
- Practice Python programming regularly to reinforce coding skills
- Consider revisiting challenging concepts like deep learning through online resources

### Engagement Opportunities
- Join Telebort's AI Project Showcase to present final project work
- Consider participation in AI workshops or competitions to apply knowledge
- Connect with peer learning groups to share knowledge and maintain motivation
- Explore AI community resources for continued learning beyond the program

### Project Extensions
- Enhance the final project with additional features or improved accuracy
- Experiment with combining different object detection methods learned
- Create a portfolio of computer vision projects for future reference
- Consider applying AI skills to real-world problems of personal interest

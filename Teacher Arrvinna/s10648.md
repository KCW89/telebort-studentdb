## Teacher Feedback
> "The student has shown commendable dedication to the Program D curriculum through their excellent attendance and consistent completion of assignments. While their understanding of core JavaScript concepts shows room for improvement as reflected in their quiz scores, the student demonstrates persistence when facing challenges. Their mid-level projects like the Budget Planner and Pet Haven showed good progress, though their final Calorie Counter project would benefit from additional refinement. With continued practice and focused attention on JavaScript fundamentals, particularly arrays, functions, and DOM manipulation, the student has the potential to strengthen their web development skills significantly." — Arrvinna

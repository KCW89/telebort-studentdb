## Skill Growth & Behavior

### Technical Skills
- Demonstrates good understanding of JavaScript concepts when present
- Successfully completed several web projects with good quality
- Shows aptitude for creating functional web applications
- Mini Project implementations rated between ★★★☆☆ and ★★★★☆ showing solid work quality

### Soft Skills
- Works efficiently to complete assignments during attended sessions
- Shows ability to catch up on missed content when present
- As noted by instructor on 11/08/2024: "Finished exercise with minimal guidance"
- Demonstrates good problem-solving skills in project implementation

### Challenges
- Very irregular attendance (40% overall) significantly impacts learning continuity
- Extended absences create gaps in foundational knowledge
- Missing consecutive sessions disrupts the progressive learning sequence
- Limited opportunity to build on concepts due to attendance pattern

## Teacher Feedback
> "The student shows good potential and aptitude for web development when present in class. Their project work, particularly the Budget Planner and Pet Haven projects which received ★★★★☆ ratings, demonstrates a solid understanding of JavaScript concepts and application. However, their irregular attendance (40%) has created significant gaps in their learning progression. When the student attends consistently for several sessions, we see marked improvement in their skills, but the frequent and sometimes extended absences make it challenging to build on previous knowledge. With more consistent participation, the student could excel in web development given their demonstrated ability to catch up quickly and work efficiently during attended sessions." — Arrvinna

## Suggestions for Parents

### Support Continued Learning
- Address attendance challenges to ensure more consistent participation
- Help establish a regular schedule for class attendance and home practice
- Consider reviewing missed lessons using online resources to fill knowledge gaps
- Establish a consistent study routine to reinforce web development concepts

### Engagement Opportunities
- Explore asynchronous learning options if scheduling conflicts persist
- Consider additional practice at home between classes to maintain momentum
- Review completed projects together to reinforce understanding
- Discuss the importance of sequential learning in programming education

### Project Extensions
- Encourage completion of the Calorie Counter project
- Practice building simple JavaScript applications at home to reinforce concepts
- Review previously completed projects to identify opportunities for enhancement
- Apply JavaScript concepts to small personal projects that align with interests

## Next Steps / Parent Actions
- [ ] Discuss attendance challenges and develop a plan for more consistent participation
- [ ] Review the current course schedule to ensure it aligns with family commitments
- [ ] Schedule a meeting with the instructor to discuss strategies for catching up on missed content
- [ ] Consider supplementary learning resources to address gaps from missed sessions
- [ ] Explore alternative class times or formats if current scheduling is problematic

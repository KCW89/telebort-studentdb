### Skill Growth & Behavior

**Technical skills:**
* Demonstrated progressive understanding of JavaScript fundamentals including variables, operators, control flow, loops, functions, arrays, and objects.
* Successfully completed several mini projects, including a BMI calculator and other interactive applications.
* Developing skills in DOM manipulation, which is crucial for web development.
* Currently working on a Greeting card project that will apply multiple concepts learned.

**Soft skills:**
* Maintains excellent attendance (92%), showing strong commitment to learning.
* Shows persistence in working through complex topics over multiple sessions.
* Demonstrates ability to build on previous knowledge to tackle increasingly complex projects.

**Challenges:**
* Quiz 1 score (60%) suggests there may be some gaps in understanding fundamental concepts.
* Some topics like Functions and Objects took multiple sessions to complete, indicating these may be more challenging areas.
* Has been late to class on two occasions.

### Teacher Feedback

The student has shown remarkable commitment to the program with consistently high attendance. They methodically work through each concept, taking the time needed to fully grasp challenging topics like Functions and DOM manipulation. Their progress through increasingly complex JavaScript concepts is steady, and they're developing a solid foundation in web development. While their Quiz 1 score indicates room for improvement in some areas, their persistent approach to learning will serve them well as they continue to build their programming skills.

### Suggestions for Parents

* Review fundamental JavaScript concepts together, particularly those covered in Quiz 1, to strengthen understanding.
* Encourage the student to practice DOM manipulation at home by creating simple interactive web pages.
* Discuss the Greeting card project they're working on and how it applies the concepts they're learning.
* Consider exploring additional resources like interactive JavaScript tutorials that might reinforce classroom learning.

### Next Steps / Parent Actions

* [ ] Review this report with the student and acknowledge their excellent attendance and steady progress.
* [ ] Discuss any challenges they're experiencing with DOM manipulation or the Greeting card project.
* [ ] Help them establish a schedule for working on programming outside of class time to reinforce concepts.
* [ ] Consider checking in with the instructor about specific areas from Quiz 1 that might need reinforcement.

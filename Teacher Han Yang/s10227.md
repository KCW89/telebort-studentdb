### Skill Growth & Behavior

**Technical skills:**
* Gained a foundational understanding of various AI concepts, including Generative AI, Word Embeddings, Neural Networks, Data Bias, Deep Learning, Computer Vision (OpenCV), Object Detection (YOLOv8, Haar Cascades), Streamlit, and Machine Learning (Regression, Classification, Clustering).
* Demonstrated the ability to work with tools like Colab Notebooks and Teachable Machine.
* Achieved a good score in Quiz 2 (76%) but could improve in Quiz 1 (48/100).
* Completed several projects and exercises, including a Chatbox, Mall Customer Segmentation, Titanic Survivors Classification, and successfully presented the Final Project.
* Showed particular strength in Object Detection with YOLOv8 (5/5 exit ticket scores) and Titanic Survivors Classification (5/5 exit ticket).

**Soft skills:**
* Maintains a good attendance record (84%) with a few absences scattered throughout the program.
* Demonstrates dedication to completing assignments and projects.
* Successfully progressed through advanced AI concepts despite some challenging areas.

**Challenges:**
* Quiz 1 score (48/100) suggests room for improvement in grasping fundamental concepts.
* Some exit ticket scores indicate areas where understanding could be strengthened, particularly in Word Representations (2/5), Data Training & Bias (2/5), and Computer Vision (1/2).
* Regression concepts seemed challenging based on the exit ticket score (1/3).
* Several absences during the program, particularly in the middle weeks.

### Teacher Feedback

The student has shown a consistent effort in learning the fundamentals of AI. They actively participate in the sessions and have completed a good amount of the assigned work. Their strengths lie in practical applications, particularly in Object Detection with YOLOv8 and the Titanic Survivors Classification project, where they achieved perfect exit ticket scores. While they have performed well in some areas and achieved a good score in Quiz 2, there are areas where their understanding can be further developed, as indicated by some of the exit ticket scores and the lower score in Quiz 1. Their successful completion of the program and final project presentation demonstrates their perseverance and commitment to learning.

### Suggestions for Parents

* Encourage the student to review the concepts related to the lessons where their exit ticket scores were lower, particularly Word Representations, Data Training & Bias, and Regression.
* Discuss the importance of thorough preparation for quizzes and tests to improve their performance.
* Support their interest in Object Detection and Computer Vision, areas where they have shown strength and potential.
* Consider exploring additional resources to reinforce AI concepts, especially those that were challenging.

### Next Steps / Parent Actions

* [ ] Review this report with the student and acknowledge their completion of the program.
* [ ] Identify areas where they might need additional support or resources to improve their understanding.
* [ ] Discuss their experience with the Final Project and what they learned from the process.
* [ ] Encourage them to continue exploring AI concepts that interest them, building on the foundation they have established.

### Skill Growth & Behavior

**Technical skills:**
* Made excellent progress through a significant portion of the curriculum, covering both Block-Based Python (BBP) fundamentals and web development concepts (HTML and CSS).
* Completed numerous projects including "Zoo Blog", "Registration Form", "My Timetable", "My Biodata", "My Favorite Game", "Musical Instruments", "E-Commerce Webpage", and "My Hobby".
* Demonstrated understanding of HTML elements, CSS styling (including Box Model, Selectors, Properties, Grid, Flexbox, and Animations), and basic Python concepts (Lists, Random Module, Conditionals).
* Achieved good scores in both Quiz 1 (88/100 and 75%) and Quiz 2 (88%).

**Soft skills:**
* Maintains excellent attendance with only one recorded absence and two instances of being late.
* Shows high commitment to completing assignments and coursework.
* Demonstrates persistence in working through multiple project components.

**Challenges:**
* Some exit ticket scores, particularly in CSS concepts (CSS Animation: 1/4, CSS Selectors: 2/6, HTML Division: 1/4), indicate areas where understanding could be further strengthened.
* Performance in "Project: My Hobby" received a lower rating than usual.

### Teacher Feedback

The student is a dedicated learner who has shown excellent aptitude for computer science concepts, as evidenced by their outstanding quiz scores (96% in both Quiz 1 and Quiz 2). They actively participate in the lessons and complete most assigned projects. While their understanding of theoretical concepts is strong, there are some areas of practical application, particularly in CSS styling, where additional practice would be beneficial. Their successful completion of the "Zoo Blog" final project demonstrates their ability to integrate multiple skills when focused on a comprehensive task.

### Suggestions for Parents

* Encourage the student to review CSS concepts where exit ticket scores were lower, such as CSS Animations, Selectors, and HTML Division.
* Review the "My Hobby" project together to identify areas for improvement.
* Support continued exploration of both Python programming and web development at home to build on classroom learning.
* Celebrate their excellent attendance and consistent completion of coursework.

### Next Steps / Parent Actions

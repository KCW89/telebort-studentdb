### Teacher Feedback

The student has shown potential in data analysis and AI concepts when present in class. Their completion of the Google Play Store project and perseverance with the final project demonstrate their capability to work with complex datasets. While their quiz performance was satisfactory, there's room for improvement in mastering fundamental concepts. Their graduation suggests they have met the basic requirements of the program, but more consistent attendance would likely have enhanced their learning experience and depth of understanding.

### Suggestions for Parents

* Encourage more regular attendance to maximize learning benefits from future programs.
* Review data analysis concepts together, particularly focusing on areas covered in exit tickets where scores were lower.
* Consider supplementary learning resources to reinforce concepts taught in class, especially in data manipulation with pandas.
* Discuss any scheduling conflicts that might be impacting attendance and explore possible solutions.
* Support continued exploration of AI concepts following the recent introduction to the topic.

### Skill Growth & Behavior

**Technical skills:**
* Has been introduced to fundamental concepts in AI, including Generative AI, Word Embeddings, Neural Networks, Data Bias, Deep Learning, Computer Vision (OpenCV), Object Detection (YOLOv8, Haar Cascades), Streamlit, and Machine Learning (Regression, Classification, Clustering, Supervised/Unsupervised Learning).
* Demonstrated the ability to work with Colab Notebooks and Teachable Machine.
* Achieved a passing score in Quiz 1 (60/100) and successfully completed multiple projects and exercises.
* Showed proficiency in Streamlit with a perfect exit ticket score (5/5).
* Successfully completed the "AI Healthcare Tracker" final project, progressing from proposal to presentation.

**Soft skills:**
* Maintains excellent attendance (88%) with only a few absences.
* Shows persistence in overcoming technical challenges, as seen with Streamlit installation issues.
* Demonstrates commitment to completing assignments and projects.

**Challenges:**
* Some exit ticket scores indicate areas where understanding could be improved, particularly in Regression (1/3) and Mall Customer Segmentation (1/5).
* Several missing exit tickets suggest possible challenges with assessment completion.
* Computer Vision concepts (ET CV: 1/2) appear to be an area requiring more focus.
* Final Project Prototype received a lower rating.

### Teacher Feedback

The student has shown consistent dedication to the AI-2 program, as evidenced by their excellent attendance and completion of all assigned projects. They have successfully navigated a broad curriculum spanning from basic machine learning concepts to advanced topics like neural networks and object detection. Their performance in Streamlit demonstrates their ability to excel when fully engaged with a topic. While some areas like Regression and Computer Vision show room for improvement, their successful completion of the "AI Healthcare Tracker" final project and graduation from the program highlight their perseverance and growth throughout the course. The student's journey through the program demonstrates how consistent effort can lead to mastery of complex AI concepts.

### Suggestions for Parents

* Encourage the student to revisit concepts where exit ticket scores were lower, such as Regression and Computer Vision.
* Discuss the importance of completing all exit tickets to gauge understanding and identify areas for improvement.
* Support their interest in areas where they excelled, particularly Streamlit and Data Preparation.
* Consider exploring applications of AI in healthcare, building on their final project experience.
* Celebrate their graduation and consistent attendance throughout the program.

### Next Steps / Parent Actions

* [ ] Review this report with the student and acknowledge their excellent attendance and successful program completion.
* [ ] Discuss their experience with the AI Healthcare Tracker project and what they learned from the process.
* [ ] Identify areas where they might want to deepen their understanding through additional resources or practice.
* [ ] Explore potential follow-up courses or projects that build on their AI foundation, particularly in healthcare applications.

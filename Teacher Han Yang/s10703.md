### Skill Growth & Behavior

**Technical skills:**
* Made significant progress in both Block-Based Python (BBP) and web development (HTML & CSS).
* Completed numerous projects and exercises, including "Zoo Blog", "Registration Form", "My Timetable", "My Biodata", "My Favorite Game", "Musical Instruments", and "My Hobby".
* Demonstrated understanding of HTML elements, CSS styling (including Box Model, Selectors, Properties, Grid, Flexbox, and Animations), and basic Python concepts (Variables, Operators, Conditionals, Lists, Random Module).
* Achieved satisfactory scores in both Quiz 1 (60%) and Quiz 2 (60%).

**Soft skills:**
* Maintains a good attendance record (81%) with a few absences scattered throughout the program.
* Shows commitment to completing assigned tasks and projects.

**Challenges:**
* Has been late for class on three occasions.
* Quiz scores (60% on both Quiz 1 and Quiz 2) suggest room for improvement in concept mastery.
* Some exit ticket scores, particularly in CSS concepts (CSS Grid: 2/4, CSS Animation: 2/4, Project Registration Form: 2/4, CSS Box model: 2/5), indicate areas where understanding could be strengthened.

### Teacher Feedback

The student has been a dedicated learner, actively participating and completing a substantial amount of work in both Python and web development. They have shown a good understanding of the concepts and have successfully completed many projects, including the comprehensive "Zoo Blog" final project. Their early work in HTML fundamentals was particularly strong, with excellent exit ticket scores. While their quiz performance shows room for improvement, their consistent project completion demonstrates a solid grasp of practical application. We encourage them to focus on improving their understanding of more complex CSS concepts and to strive for punctuality in attending the sessions.

### Suggestions for Parents

* Encourage the student to review the material for both quizzes to strengthen their understanding of fundamental concepts.
* Discuss the importance of punctuality for all online sessions.
* Review CSS concepts together, particularly focusing on Grid, Animation, and Box Model where exit ticket scores were lower.
* Support their learning by exploring simple web development or Python programming activities at home.

### Next Steps / Parent Actions

* [ ] Review this report with the student.
* [ ] Discuss strategies for improving quiz performance and ensuring timely attendance.
* [ ] Explore some of their completed projects together and ask them to explain how they work.
* [ ] Encourage them to continue exploring their interests in both Python and web development.

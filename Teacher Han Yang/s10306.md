## Teacher Feedback

The student's attendance has been a major concern, with a large number of missed classes. This has likely impacted their learning and engagement with the course material. While they have attended some sessions and attempted exercises, the inconsistent participation and several low or missing exit ticket scores suggest difficulties in understanding the concepts. Consistent attendance and active participation are crucial for successful learning in this program.

## Suggestions for Parents

* Please review the student's attendance record and encourage consistent participation in all future sessions.
* Discuss the importance of attending all classes to keep up with the curriculum and engage with the learning materials.
* Encourage them to review the topics covered in the missed sessions and reach out to the instructor for any clarification or support needed.
* Consider setting up a regular schedule for them to catch up on missed content and practice the concepts at home.

## Next Steps / Parent Actions

## Skill Growth & Behavior

**Technical Skills:**
* Introduced to fundamental concepts of AI and Machine Learning, including Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Regression, Classification, and Clustering.
* Gained experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Processing.
* Developed skills in Computer Vision using OpenCV, including Image Processing, Face Detection, and Object Detection with YOLOv8.
* Introduced to Deep Learning concepts and Image Classification.
* Explored Streamlit for creating web applications.
* Worked on a final project in a team, demonstrating collaborative skills.

**Soft Skills:**
* Actively participated in cohort learning and completed assigned tasks.
* Demonstrated good problem-solving skills through various exercises and projects.
* Collaborated with their teammate on the final project, progressing through proposal, prototype, and presentation stages.

**Challenges:**
* Performance in Quiz 1 was lower than expected.
* Some exit ticket scores, particularly in Streamlit and Mall Customer Segmentation, indicate areas where further understanding could be developed.

## Teacher Feedback

"The student has been an engaged student in the AI program, showing a good understanding of various concepts. Their work on the final project with their teammate is progressing well. While their performance in the first quiz was not as strong, their engagement in other lessons and their exit ticket scores in areas like Deep Learning and Face Detection are positive. We encourage them to review the material related to the first quiz and to continue their collaborative work on the final project." - Puvin

## Suggestions for Parents

* Encourage the student to review the concepts covered in the earlier lessons, particularly those related to the first quiz and Streamlit.
* Support their collaborative work on the final project and encourage effective communication with their teammate.
* Celebrate their consistent engagement and progress in the program.

## Next Steps / Parent Actions

* [x] Review this report with the student.
* [ ] Discuss their progress in the program, acknowledging their efforts and identifying areas for improvement.

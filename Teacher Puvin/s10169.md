## Skill Growth & Behavior

**Technical Skills:**
* Introduced to fundamental concepts of AI and Machine Learning, including Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Regression, Classification, and Clustering.
* Gained experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Processing.
* Developed skills in Computer Vision using OpenCV, including Image Processing and Object Detection with YOLOv8 and Haar Cascades.
* Introduced to Deep Learning concepts and Image Classification.
* Explored Streamlit for creating web applications.
* Worked on a final project in a team, demonstrating collaborative skills.

**Soft Skills:**
* Actively participated in cohort learning and completed assigned tasks.
* Demonstrated good problem-solving skills through various exercises and projects.
* Collaborated with their teammate on the final project, progressing through proposal, prototype, and presentation stages.

**Challenges:**
* Some exit ticket scores, particularly in Deep Learning and Object Detection, indicate areas where further understanding could be developed.
* Performance in some quizzes was also below expectations.

## Teacher Feedback

"The student has shown consistent participation in the AI program and has been actively working with their teammate on the final project. They have progressed well through the different stages of the project. While their understanding of some concepts, as reflected in some exit ticket and quiz scores, could be strengthened, their overall engagement and effort are commendable. We encourage them to review the material related to areas where they faced difficulties and to continue their collaborative work on the final project." - Puvin

## Suggestions for Parents

* Encourage the student to review the concepts where their exit ticket and quiz scores were lower, such as Deep Learning and Object Detection.
* Support their collaborative work on the final project and encourage effective communication with their teammate.
* Remind them to seek clarification from the instructor on any topics they find challenging.

## Next Steps / Parent Actions

* [x] Review this report with the student.
* [ ] Discuss their progress in the program, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement.

## Skill Growth & Behavior

**Technical Skills:**
* Introduced to fundamental concepts of AI and Machine Learning, including Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Regression, Classification, and Clustering.
* Gained experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Processing.
* Developed skills in Computer Vision using OpenCV, including Image Processing and Object Detection with YOLOv13.
* Introduced to Deep Learning concepts and Image Classification.
* Explored Streamlit for creating web applications.
* Worked on a final project in a team, demonstrating collaborative skills.

**Soft Skills:**
* Actively participated in cohort learning and completed assigned tasks.
* Demonstrated good problem-solving skills through various exercises and projects.
* Collaborated with their teammate on the final project, progressing through proposal, prototype, and presentation stages.

**Challenges:**

* Some exit ticket scores, particularly in Image Processing, indicate areas where further understanding could be developed.

## Teacher Feedback

"The student has been a highly engaged student in the AI program, consistently attending classes and actively participating in the learning activities. Their collaboration on the final project with their teammate has been progressing well. While their score in the recent quiz was lower, their performance in other areas, including several exit tickets, has been good. We encourage them to review the concepts related to the quiz and to continue their excellent work on the final project." - Puvin

## Suggestions for Parents

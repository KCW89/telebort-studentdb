## Skill Growth & Behavior

**Technical Skills:**
* Introduced to fundamental concepts of AI and Machine Learning, including Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Regression, Classification, and Clustering.
* Gained experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Processing.
* Developed skills in Computer Vision using OpenCV, including Image Processing and Face Detection.
* Introduced to Deep Learning concepts and Image Classification.
* Explored Streamlit for creating web applications.
* Worked on a final project in a team, contributing to the prototype and proposal stages.

**Soft Skills:**
* Participated in cohort learning and completed assigned tasks.
* Demonstrated problem-solving skills through various exercises and projects.
* Collaborated with their teammate on the final project.

**Challenges:**
* Attendance has been inconsistent in recent weeks.
* Performance in Quiz 1 and some exit tickets indicates areas where further understanding could be developed.

## Teacher Feedback

"The student has been participating in the AI program and has shown progress in understanding various concepts. Their collaboration with their teammate on the final project is noted. However, there has been inconsistency in attendance in recent weeks, which might impact their learning. We encourage them to attend all remaining sessions and to review the material, particularly in areas where their quiz and exit ticket scores were lower, to ensure a strong understanding of the concepts before the final project presentation." - Puvin

## Suggestions for Parents

* Please encourage the student to attend all remaining classes to maximize their learning in the program.
* Support their engagement in the final project and encourage them to work closely with their teammate.
* Consider discussing the importance of consistent attendance and identifying any potential challenges.

## Next Steps / Parent Actions

* [x] Review this report with the student.
* [ ] Discuss the importance of consistent attendance for the remainder of the program.
* [ ] Encourage them to actively participate in the final project and to seek help when needed.
* [ ] Follow up with Puvin if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding their progress and attendance.

## Teacher Feedback
> "The student has shown good progress in web development concepts during their attended sessions. Their completed projects on Glitch demonstrate a growing understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals. However, their attendance pattern (55%) presents a challenge to continuous skill development, particularly with three consecutive absences in February. When present, the student engages well with the material and completes assignments with satisfactory results. Their recent work with CSS selectors and the My Superhero activity shows promising creative application of web design principles. With more consistent attendance and regular practice, the student could significantly strengthen their web development skills." — Mardhiah

## Teacher Feedback
> "The student demonstrates exceptional aptitude for programming and shows genuine enthusiasm for Scratch development. Their ability to grasp complex concepts like Lists (★★★★★) and complete multiple lessons in a single session indicates their strong potential. While the student sometimes prefers to rush through material they find easy, they have agreed to follow the structured curriculum to build a solid foundation for their upcoming Scratch competition in October. With their natural talent and continued practice, the student has excellent potential to excel in programming competitions and beyond. I recommend focusing on refining their systematic problem-solving approach while encouraging their enthusiasm for advanced concepts." — Mardhiah

## Suggestions for Parents

### Support Continued Learning
- Encourage a balance between competition preparation and foundational learning
- Support regular practice with Scratch projects that combine multiple concepts
- Help establish a systematic approach to problem-solving rather than rushing
- Consider exploring additional programming concepts beyond the curriculum

### Engagement Opportunities
- Support preparation for the upcoming Scratch competition in October
